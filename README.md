# Savings Interest Calculator

This React app is, as the name implies, a Savings Interest Calculator. It is an extension of my Budget Breakdown Calculator (i.e. If one has excess spending money after all the bills are paid, what does one do with that money?) and is inspired by the one of the best pieces of financial advice that I've ever received:

<i>Always pay yourself first.</i>
